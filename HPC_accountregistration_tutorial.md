### Registration process for getting access to [MLS&WISO BwForCluster](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwForCluster_MLS%26WISO_Production).

Granting access to a BwForCluster involves multiple steps from users in order to get access to HPC. For this process, you need a valid University ID (eg. xy123) and password. 

#### **STEP 1: Become a part of an rechenvorhaben (RV) for getting access to Bwforcluster MLS&WISO.** 

There are two ways to do this, either by joining as a coworker or creating a new one RV if your advisor has not registered already for HPC access.

##### Create a new RV application for getting access to Bwforcluster MLS&WISO: 
- For creating a new RV, the user (advisor) can fill an RV form here. (https://zas.bwhpc.de/shib/en/bwforcluster_proposal.php). 
- Note: In order to ensure that your Rechenvorhaben can be assigned to MLS&WISO cluster successfully, you can also send an application in advance to the HPC support for a review of your application.  

##### Become Coworker of an "RV" : 
- To become coworker of an RV, please login at https://www.bwhpc-c5.de/en/ZAS/bwforcluster_collaboration.php and provide acronym and password. 
- "RV responsible" (your supervisor/advisor) can provide the RV acronym and password.  You will be assigned to the 'RV' as a member. 
- Note: After submitting the request you will receive an email from ZAS about the further steps (i.e. personal registration at assigned bwForCluster). The RV owner and any managers will be notified automatically. You can see your RV memberships at https://www.bwhpc-c5.de/en/ZAS/info_rv.php


#### **STEP 2: BwForCluster entitlement: Apply for Permission from your university to use a bwForCluster.**

- Click to the follwing link: https://bwforcluster.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php?p=vor_registrierung (For other participating state universities, select your university from here: https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwForCluster_Entitlement).
- Note: 
    - For this step, please make sure to choose the correct Institute. For example, "Pharmakologisches Institut" from the list of institutes. 
    - Coworkers "who have not applied before or who does not have an approved entitlement" already for Bwforcluster should apply. Please inform the responsible contact person (Ansprechpartner) mentioned on the page in advance that there will be an automated email sent to them for approving your application.

#### **STEP 3: Personal registration at the cluster site based on approved RV (step1) and issued bwForCluster entitlement (step2).**

- Go to this link and select the university : https://bwservices.uni-heidelberg.de/
- Go to this link (https://bwservices.uni-heidelberg.de/user/twofa.xhtml) and set up a 2-factor authentication using an authenticator app on your smartphone, e.g. Google Authenticator. A 6-digit code is displayed on this app. Once you have access to the cluster, You will need this code as a one time passowrd (OTP) while logging into the cluster. This step is important for security purposes.
- The final step is to [Set a service password](https://bwservices.uni-heidelberg.de/) which is different from your UNI-ID password.
